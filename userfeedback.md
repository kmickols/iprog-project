User test:

The user tried the app both as host and client, respectively. As host, they tried on desktop and as client on mobile. 
Firstly, they tried the tutorial page. The user wanted to have a more elaborate tutorial, and we expanded the instructions. 

Initially trying the app as host, the user thought our application was nice but a bit dull, and that it would be nice to make it more obvious that the buttons are interactive (when they should be). We changed this by adding a background color & pointer when the user hovered over the buttons. We also changed the background from a solid color to an image. The user was frustrated that they had to log in to Spotify again when starting a new quiz, and we made the Spotify log in automatic if already logged in. 

As mobile user, the user thought the app was straightforward but had some items not aligned and that the header was too large. We aligned the items and changed the css so that font size would be adjusted for the mobile user. At the end of the quiz, the user wanted to be able to see their final score on their own screen and not just at the hostâ€™s screen. We therefore added this feature as well. The user also thought it was a bit annoying that a new code was generated when the same host created a new game, and therefore we changed it to keeping the old room code when generating another quiz.
